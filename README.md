# 🧮 Superstore Sales Analysis with Data Vault 2.0

This project is a full end-to-end data analysis pipeline built using the **Superstore Sales dataset** and modeled using a **Data Vault 2.0 architecture**. It showcases my skills in **SQL**, **data modeling**, **ETL**, and **exploratory business analysis** — with a focus on **Sales, Pricing, and Financial metrics**.

> 📌 This project is designed to simulate a real-world, analytics-ready data pipeline that I would use in a business analyst or data analyst role.
